# ChatGPT Braindump Prompt for Nico.AI

Copy and paste everything below this line into ChatGPT:

---

I need you to help me create a structured braindump of my professional information. This will be used to power an AI chatbot on my personal website that answers questions about my career, expertise, and how I work.

The chatbot already knows my career timeline, client list, personality, and values. What it's missing is **specifics** — the kind of detail that makes the bot actually useful to someone evaluating whether to work with me.

Here's what the chatbot ALREADY knows from my Deloitte one-pager — don't re-ask me these, just build on them:

**Recent Deloitte Engagements (already captured):**
- State of Texas DFPS — Project Lead: Led discovery and implementation for a contract management system using Conga CLM and Salesforce. Stakeholder personas, requirements, architecture, roadmap, user story development, data model design, team staffing.
- CFPB — Functional Lead / Project Lead: Current state assessment of complaint management processes, rearchitected the process, maintained product backlog, defined requirements, guided team through milestones.
- City of New York — Technical Lead: Technical solution oversight, resolved technical issues, coordinated with Salesforce Architect, aligned sprint plans with product manager and functional lead.
- T. Rowe Price — Project Manager / Functional Lead: Managed CRM, data, and MDM workstreams. Cross-company program coordination.
- Johnson & Johnson MedTech — Delivery Lead: Customer success capability map, incorporated end user requirements.
- Johnson & Johnson Janssen — Delivery Lead: Options and estimates for deploying a global medical information call center. Cross-company coordination.
- UCB — Delivery Lead: Led estimating effort for Health Cloud vs Patient Connect implementation.
- Medtronic — Delivery Lead: Discovery and assessment for CRM implementation. Led LMS system implementation with Salesforce integration.

**Certifications (already captured):**
- Agile Certified Professional
- Salesforce Certifications: Admin, Sales Cloud, Health Cloud, UX Designer, Business Analyst, AI Associate, Agentforce Specialist

**Tools/Skills (already captured):**
- Strategy: Planning, Development and Implementation
- Project Tools: JIRA, Rally, MS Project, Azure Boards
- Programming: Java, SQL, C++, HTML, Salesforce Platform Tools

Now please walk me through these three sections one at a time. After I answer each section, move to the next. At the end, compile everything into a single structured document I can hand to my developer.

## SECTION 1: CAREER DEPTH — FILLING THE GAPS

The Deloitte one-pager gives WHAT you did but not the IMPACT. I need the "so what" layer. Help me add:

1. For the engagements listed above — can you add measurable outcomes to any of them? (Team sizes you managed, timelines delivered, cost savings, systems launched, users impacted, anything with a number)
2. Beyond these recent ones, what are 3-5 OTHER major engagements from your career (Deloitte or earlier at Accenture, Siebel, RunE2E) that showcase different skills? Same format: what was broken, what you did, what happened.
3. What's your signature move — the thing you do in the first 30-60 days of any engagement that sets you apart?
4. What types of problems do clients typically bring you? What's the "before" state vs. the "after" state?
5. What's the project you're most proud of and why?
6. How would a former client or colleague describe working with you in 2-3 sentences?
7. What's your actual role at Astound Digital right now? What are you working on day-to-day?

## SECTION 2: ADVISORY & CONSULTING APPROACH

My chatbot says I advise founders and executives but can't explain how. Help me articulate:

1. When you advise someone, what's your methodology? Do you have a framework, a process, a playbook?
2. What size companies do you work best with? (Revenue range, headcount, stage)
3. What are your engagement models? (Retainer, project-based, equity, hybrid?)
4. What industries or problems are you most excited about right now?
5. Give me a recent advisory win — even anonymously. What was the situation, what did you do, what happened?
6. What do you NOT do? What should someone NOT come to you for?
7. What makes you different from a Big 4 or McKinsey consultant?

## SECTION 3: EDUCATION — WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GOT OUT OF IT

My chatbot lists credentials but can't explain their value. I need the "so what" for each:

**Georgia Tech — B.S. Electrical Engineering**
- What years did you attend?
- Any honors, activities, or formative experiences?
- How does an EE degree shape how you think about business problems?

**Harvard Business School Online — CORe (Credential of Readiness)**
Three courses that make up CORe:

1. **Business Analytics** (taught by Janice Hammond) — focused on using statistical analysis and data to solve real business problems. How do you apply this in your work? What clicked for you?

2. **Economics for Managers** (taught by Bharat Anand) — focused on how markets work and firms compete, applying economic principles to business decisions. How did this change how you think about strategy or competition?

3. **Financial Accounting** (taught by V.G. Narayanan) — focused on reading and interpreting financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow). How do you use this when evaluating businesses or advising clients?

**Other HBS Online courses:**
- **Disruptive Strategy** — what did you take away? How do you apply it?
- **Leading with Finance** — same question.

**Salesforce Certifications (already listed: Admin, Sales Cloud, Health Cloud, UX Designer, Business Analyst, AI Associate, Agentforce Specialist):**
- Why did you pursue this stack of Salesforce certs? How does it help your consulting work?
- Which cert was the hardest or most valuable?

**Other credentials:**
- Any other certifications beyond Agile and Salesforce? (PMP, SAFe, Six Sigma, etc.)
- Any courses or programs you're currently taking or planning?

**FINAL STEP:** After all three sections are complete, compile my answers into a single structured document with clear section headers. Keep my exact words where possible — don't rewrite my voice. Format it so it can be dropped directly into an AI system prompt as knowledge.
