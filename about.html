            <h2 class="section-heading">Early Life: Zambia → America</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Luanshya, Zambia. My early childhood there was stable and meaningful—we didn't leave out of hardship. My family moved to the United States when I was 10 because they were thinking long-term: education, opportunity, and a bigger future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my most formative lessons came through my father's work. As a kid, I spent time around his shop and absorbed the rhythm of business early—customers, relationships, trust, and service delivered in real time. I didn't call it "people skills" back then, but that's exactly what it was: learning how to communicate, listen, carry myself with confidence, and treat every interaction as reputation-building.

            <p>
                In the U.S., those same lessons continued through the motel business. If you want a real-world education in people and problem-solving, spend time in hospitality. There's always interaction—needs, complaints, questions, and unexpected issues that have to be handled professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                That environment trains you to manage emotions (yours and others), stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly, and solve problems without drama. Those habits became embedded in how I operate and lead to this day.

            <p>
                After high school, I worked at a bank as a drive-through teller. It taught me what it means to represent an institution: consistency, reliability, process discipline, and delivering service at a high standard—every day, not just when it's convenient.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was also an early lesson in systems: you can't improvise your way through everything. You need structure.

        <!-- Consulting -->
        <div class="section-block">
            <p class="section-label">Professional Growth</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">College → Consulting</h2>
            <p>
                As I transitioned from college into the professional world, consulting immediately made sense for my personality and strengths. Consulting is a people business. Yes, it involves technology, process, and strategy—but at its core, it's about earning trust quickly, understanding what a client truly needs (often before they can articulate it), aligning stakeholders with competing priorities, navigating ambiguity, and delivering outcomes under real pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the true proving ground before consulting was Georgia Tech. I studied Electrical Engineering in an environment where expectations were high and the competition was intense. The pace was relentless. You were surrounded by some of the smartest students in the room—people who could solve complex problems quickly, think analytically, and perform at a high level consistently. Georgia Tech forced discipline: you couldn't coast, you couldn't fake it, and you couldn't rely on talent alone. You had to develop work ethic, resilience, and the ability to push through hard problems until you reached clarity. That experience didn't just sharpen my technical foundation—it built the mental endurance and precision that later became essential in consulting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first true consulting experience was with Siebel Systems. That role came with extensive travel and was my introduction to what top-tier client delivery demands: adaptability, speed, professionalism, and the ability to walk into unfamiliar environments and build credibility quickly. You learn how to read a room, communicate with different personalities, handle pressure, and still deliver—regardless of how messy the situation is behind the scenes. It was a crash course in execution and in becoming dependable to clients who are often making high-stakes decisions with limited time.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, my path expanded through premier global consulting organizations, including Accenture and Deloitte—firms known for operating at the highest levels of digital transformation and technology-enabled delivery. Working in those environments raises the bar again. You're surrounded by strong leaders and sharp teams, and you're expected to perform with structure, clarity, and high standards. The work becomes less about doing a task and more about leading outcomes: setting direction, managing risk, influencing executives, and ensuring delivery across complex stakeholder ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, I gained the depth that comes only from repetition at scale—working across many clients, industries, and delivery models; solving different problems; and learning how to produce results in environments where priorities shift, legacy systems resist change, and organizational politics can derail progress. Being pushed hard—first in engineering school and then in consulting alongside some of the brightest minds—became an advantage. It built a mindset I still rely on today: stay calm, learn fast, communicate clearly, and execute with discipline.

                That breadth teaches you something important: technology alone doesn't transform anything—people do. Strategy alone doesn't create value—execution does.

            <p>
                Over time, a few beliefs became non-negotiable for me:

                    <div class="belief-text"><strong>Governance isn't bureaucracy—it's protection.</strong> It reduces rework, clarifies decisions, and keeps teams moving.</div>

                This is the leadership style I carry today: calm, clear, structured, relationship-driven, and accountable to results.

        <!-- Today -->
        <div class="section-block">
            <p class="section-label">Present</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">What I Do Today</h2>
            <p>
                Today, my identity is simple: I invest in and advise businesses on strategy, operations, go-to-market, and technology-enabled transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm effective in high-stakes environments because my foundation was built early—customer interaction, service, business discipline, and the ability to understand people and operate under pressure without losing focus.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="quote-block">
            <p class="quote-text">
                I lead with clarity, calm, and execution. Transformation succeeds when leaders communicate the why, teams understand the what, and delivery is disciplined enough to produce outcomes. I'm relationship-first—but I'm accountable to results—because strategy without execution is just conversation.
